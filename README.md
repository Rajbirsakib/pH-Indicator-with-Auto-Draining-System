A pH Indicator with Auto Draining System is an automated system designed to measure the pH level of a solution and control its drainage based on predefined pH thresholds. Using an Arduino Uno, this project integrates a pH sensor to detect the acidity or alkalinity of a liquid. When the pH level exceeds or falls below a set range, the Arduino triggers a mechanism (such as a pump or valve) to drain the liquid automatically, ensuring that the solution remains within the desired pH levels. This system is useful in various applications, including hydroponics, water treatment, and chemical processing, where maintaining a stable pH is critical.
